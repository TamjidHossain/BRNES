This project was built on Python 3.9. All the experiements are executed in the Predetor-Prey (PP) domain (https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2017/pdfs/p1722.pdf), we included the version we used in the **PP_environment** folder (slightly different from the standard PP domain). For the graph generation code you will need to install Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Files

The folder **PP_environment** contains the Predetor-Prey environment (also called as a Pursuit domain) we used for experiements

The folder **Main** contains our implementation of all algorithm and experiements

Finally, the folder **ProcessedFiles** contains already processed .pickle files for graph printing and data visulaization
